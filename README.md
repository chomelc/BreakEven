## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chomelc/BreakEven.git
cd BreakEven
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

### 🏗️ Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The `dist` folder will contain the production-ready build.

### 🔍 Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## 🌐 Internationalization (i18n)

BreakEven supports multiple languages using `i18next`, `react-i18next`, and `i18next-browser-languagedetector`.

- **Translation files**: `src/locales/*.json` (e.g., `en.json`, `fr.json`, `de.json`, `es.json`, `nl.json`)
- **Initialization**: `src/lib/i18n.ts` registers resources and sets `fallbackLng: 'en'`
- **Detection**: language is detected via `localStorage` and the browser (`navigator`), cached in `localStorage`
- **Manual switching**: use the in-app language toggle

### ➕ Add a new language
1. Create `src/locales/<lang>.json`
2. Import and register it in `src/lib/i18n.ts` under `resources`
3. (Optional) Expose it in the language toggle UI if needed

## 📜 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run build:dev` - Build in development mode
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## 🏷️ Releasing

Simple manual flow:

1. Bump version in `package.json`
2. Build locally
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Test the preview build
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
4. Commit, tag, and push
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: release vX.Y.Z"
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push && git push --tags
   ```

Deploy according to your hosting setup (e.g., upload `dist/` or use CI).

## 📤 Deployment (GitHub Pages)

Vite apps on GitHub Pages need the correct `base` path when the site is served from a subpath (e.g., `username.github.io/REPO`).

1) Set Vite base (only when deploying to a project page)

- Edit `vite.config.ts` and set:
  ```ts
  export default defineConfig({
    base: '/BreakEven/', // replace with your REPO name
    // ...
  })
  ```
  Skip this if deploying to a user/org page root (`username.github.io`).

2) Build
```bash
npm run build
```

3) Publish `dist/` to `gh-pages` branch

- Manual (subtree):
  ```bash
  git add -f dist
  git commit -m "chore: publish"
  git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
  ```
  If the branch doesn't exist, create it first:
  ```bash
  git push origin `git subtree split --prefix dist main`:gh-pages --force
  ```

4) Configure Pages

- In GitHub → Settings → Pages:
  - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
  - Branch: `gh-pages` / root

Optional: GitHub Actions

- Add a workflow that builds and deploys `dist/` to `gh-pages` on push to `main`.

## 🧹 Code Style

- TypeScript-first; avoid `any` and unsafe casts
- Prefer small, focused components and descriptive names
- Keep control flow flat with early returns where possible
- Match existing formatting; run `npm run lint` before commit
- Keep comments for non-obvious rationale, not restating code

## 🤝 Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! To get started:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature
   ```
2. Install deps and run the dev server
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Keep code clean and typed
   - Run `npm run lint` and fix issues
   - Prefer clear variable names and small components
4. Add tests or examples where useful (screenshots/gifs in PRs help)
5. For translations
   - Add `src/locales/<lang>.json`
   - Register it in `src/lib/i18n.ts`
6. Open a Pull Request with a clear description and scope

### 🔓 Enabling Pro Features (Honor System)

This project is a portfolio/learning showcase. Pro feature checks are intentionally client-side and rely on trust rather than hard enforcement.

How it works today:

1. **License Keys (for demo UX)**: The app compares entered keys (SHA256) with hashes in `/public/valid-keys.json`. This file is public by design to demonstrate the flow. It is not meant for real security.

2. **Development Mode** (Optional): To explore everything locally, you can bypass checks:
   ```bash
   echo "VITE_PRO_ENABLED=true" > .env.local
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Upsell UX**: Without a key, Pro routes (`/churn-calculator`, `/mrr-simulator`, `/retention-calculator`) display an informational page and invitation to support.

---

## 🤔 Why this approach?

- I want to keep the repo open and transparent, and invite support rather than lock features down.
- There is no server component; any checks are purely for user experience, not for strong protection.
- If you enjoy the tools, please consider supporting the project, it helps me keep improving it.
